Submitted by: Everton Miller

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

Change the order of the pattern

Increase the pattern's length


- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
I did not use any outside resources or assistance in this project

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The only challenge I faced was the implementation of the game keeping track of the guesses.
It me the most time to figure out on my own, taking roughly 2 hours of the whole project to come up with a solution.
Admittingly, I used the code given in the pre-work instructions as a base for my guess function code.
Outside of that, I had no major issues in regards to completing the project.
All other problems were just small things like not using the proper case for calling functions in Java and in HTML.
The syntax was able to help me find such problems relatively quickly.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)


How do web developers create such elaborate and eccentric graphics on websites?
Is it possible to make a functional website in another form of media like in a video game?
How do you make codes that interact with the computer itself like opening Windows Explorer?
What goes into planning a website?
How do web developers make accommodations for users on mobile and browser compatible video game devices?
What is usually the biggest hurdle a web developer face when making a website?
How do web developers protect their works from outside attacks and hackers as a whole?
What was the relationship between HTML and Adobe Flash?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)


Although I do not know to do this as of now, I would have implemented a little intro for the game to hype up the game itself.
Another thing would be to make the background livelier by putting graphics in the background of the game to make it look better but not too distracting to take away the focus of the player as they were playing.
Lastly putting some intense music in the background while the game was going would really make the game more fun in my opinion and I would love to put it in the game if I had more time.
